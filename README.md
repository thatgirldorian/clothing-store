# clothing-store
 This is a clothing store web application built with Node JS. The product and user data are stored in JSON format in a data store that was created from scratch (using JavaScript classes and methods). This application also runs on cookie-based authentication that is managed by the npm package, cookie-session and paired with a hash+salted algorithm for storing passwords. 
 
I used the package, Express-validator for form validation (email & password).
 
 This store application allows an admin user to:
 - sign up, log in and log out
 - create, update and delete products
